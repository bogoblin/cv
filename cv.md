Programming is my passion and I have strong knowledge in a variety
of technical areas, as well as the ability to organise and
communicate. I am a strong advocate of agile development and
DevOps, and feel strongly that engineers and business staff should
be working together towards the business goals of the company.

## Previous Employment - Digital Applications International (DAI)

Worked as a software engineer for the Carrier Management System, a Java server that provides labels and shipping information used in fulfilment centres for clients such as Screwfix, Boden, Clarks and Tesco.

My responsibilities involved designing and implementing new systems, liasing with customers, testing with JUnit and Mockito, writing shell scripts, managing Jenkins jobs, setting up databases (MSSQL and Postgres), and more.

I also spent time onboarding new members of the team, helping them set up their development environment, teaching computer science and IT knowledge, and helping with emerging problems and debugging.

DAI are owned by Dematic and produce software for warehouses with Dematic products around the world. I worked there from September 2019 to October 2020.
