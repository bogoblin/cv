I'm looking to contribute to important and challenging projects for a
modern tech organisation where I can grow and learn. I want to come up
with ideas and lead teams, and I greatly value the potential of proper
DevOps and Agile practices, and nothing makes me happier than seeing
people use and enjoy my work.

After what I would consider a false start at my last company, I want to
get back to professional work delivering excellent code.
